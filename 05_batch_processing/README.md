# Batch Processing

## Overview
Automating geospatial operations across multiple files, datasets, or iterations. Instead of processing files one at a time, batch processing allows you to apply the same workflow to dozens, hundreds, or thousands of files efficiently.

## When to Use This
- Process all shapefiles in a directory
- Convert multiple file formats at once
- Apply the same analysis to different regions
- Reproject an entire folder of spatial data
- Clip multiple datasets to the same boundary
- Generate reports for each feature in a dataset
- Process time-series data (one file per date/year)
- Automate recurring geospatial workflows
- Quality control across multiple datasets
