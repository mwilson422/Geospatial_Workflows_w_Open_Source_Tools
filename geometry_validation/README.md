# Geometry Validation & Repair

## Overview
Detecting and fixing invalid geometries in spatial data. Invalid geometries can cause errors in spatial operations, incorrect analysis results, and software crashes. This workflow helps identify, diagnose, and repair geometric problems.

## When to Use This
- Data fails to load or process correctly
- Spatial operations (buffer, intersection, union) produce errors
- Geometries appear corrupted in GIS software
- Preparing data for strict validation requirements (e.g., topology rules)
- Quality control before publishing datasets
- Fixing legacy or imported data with geometry issues
- Troubleshooting "TopologyException" or similar errors
